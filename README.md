This repository is my work sample of Robot Framework using Selenium library. It can be also used for learning Robot Framework syntax so please feel free to use it in Your own test environment.
Tests are based on SauceLabs demo web page https://www.saucedemo.com so I cannot promise that it will remain unchanged and these Robot automated test cases work always.

Check Robot Framework installation instructions from https://robotframework.org/

The Doc -folder contains an excel table in which the manual test cases are defined and on which the automated test cases are based.

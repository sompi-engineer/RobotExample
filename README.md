This repository is my work sample of Robot Framework using Selenium and Requests libraries. It can be also used for learning Robot Framework syntax so please feel free to use it in Your own test environment.
Tests are based on SauceLabs demo web page https://www.saucedemo.com and ReqRes API page https://reqres.in so I cannot promise that those pages will remain unchanged and these Robot automated test cases work always.

Check Robot Framework installation instructions from https://robotframework.org/

The Doc -folder contains an excel table in which the manual web test cases are defined and on which the automated web test cases are based.
